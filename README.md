# OpenLCR fork of pkts.io

This is a fork of the pkts.io library with specific changes for the OpenLCR project.  The goal is to move to the master branch of pkts and have the required changes integrated but until that is done this repo will exist to hold our specific required version of the project.  Unless you're trying to build OpenLCR you shouldn't use this fork.
